</p>

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the College of Electrical and Information Engineering of [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/), and was fortunately supervised by Prof. [Shutao Li](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1279/5237.htm) and Prof. [Bin Sun](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1549/8165.htm). I received his B.S. degree from [Yanshan University](https://www.ysu.edu.cn/) in 2018. My research interests include natural language process, human-robot interaction and multimodal fusion. I serve as a peer reviewer for international conferences, such as AAAI, ACL, and EMNLP.
